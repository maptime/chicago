Join us on October 23rd to discuss the basics of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), "a modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps." You've probably heard about Leaflet, but it's not always clear what it is or why it's becoming so popular. We'll cover what Leaflet is, why you might want to use it and how to get your map on the web. 

Beginners and seasoned map-folk very welcome! If you're new, come and learn. If you're already familiar, come help someone else learn or brush up on your skills. Maptime is always interactive, so bring a laptop! 

The event will take place at the ThoughtWorks Chicago office, [200 East Randolph St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+E+Randolph+St,+Chicago,+IL+60601/@41.8850791,-87.6217435,17z/), 25th floor. You'll need to bring an ID to check in with security at the front desk.
