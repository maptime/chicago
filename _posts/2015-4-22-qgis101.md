We've had a lot of fun putting creating maps for the web, but sometimes the job requires you to break out the desktop GIS and dig in. This month we'll take a look at QGIS, a powerful and full-featured open-source desktop GIS. If this is all Greek to you, don't worry! We'll talk about why you might choose to use a desktop GIS before test-driving some of QGIS' many features. 

## Supplies

QGIS is a fairly large program and it is **hightly recommended** that you install it ahead of time. Here are some places you can get QGIS: 

1. Head to the official [QGIS homepage](http://qgis.com/) and follow the directions for your respective operating system. 
    - **Windows users:** if you think you might be using a lot of QGIS in the future, check out the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) (Open Source Geospatial for Windows) installer. Otherwise, just grab the standalone installer from the [QGIS homepage](http://qgis.com/). 
    - **Mac users:** there are a few options, but unless you're very comfortable working with package managers and experimental builds, it's going to be easiest to grab QGIS from the [KyngChaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis) page. Just be sure to download and install all of the prerequisites listed on the page (GDAL 1.11 and Matplotlib). 
2. Grab an installer from [Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/qgis/qgis-download/). Note that registration is required for this option. 

Maptime is always interactive, so **don't forget to bring your laptop**! As always, **beginners are very welcome**.
