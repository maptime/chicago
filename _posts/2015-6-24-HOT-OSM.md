### UPDATE: Rescheduled to June 24th!

For this month's installment of Maptime, we're going to put our OSM skills to work contributing to Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hotosm.org/) (HOT) applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development. We will: 

1. Learn about the Humanitarian OpenStreetMapTeam (HOT) 
2. Get introduced to / do a quick refresher on OpenStreetMap and 
3. Dive into contributing to a HOT project using the tasking manager.

Maptime is always interactive, so don't forget to bring your laptop! As always, beginners are very welcome.
