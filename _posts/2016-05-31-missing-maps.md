## Our topic: Missing Maps

_Beginners are always welcome_

Maptime headquarters designated May as **Missing Maps Month**, an opportunity for all Maptime chapters to spend some time editing maps for one of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s (HOT) current projects.  

_The purpose is to map disaster-prone areas before the disaster occurs. _  

From the [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org) website, "Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts.  

It's an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people."

**What we will do**

1.  Quick OpenStreetMap refresher for those who missed Maptime Chicago in March. Get a head start by [reviewing this tutorial](http://www.missingmaps.org/contribute/#learn).
2.  Add features to a Missing Maps project by digitizing points, lines, and polygons from satellite data. 

**You will need**

*   A laptop
*   A free OpenStreetMap account ([create one now](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new))
