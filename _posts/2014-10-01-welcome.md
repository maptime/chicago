MaptimeChi is Chicago's offshoot of MaptimeSF, a weekly meetup of mappers and map learners interested in creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies. 

Beginners are always very welcome!

Events will be posted here monthly. If you'd like to contribute, help organize an event or have a fantastic idea, please reach out to [@MaptimeChi](http://twitter.com/maptimechi) or [@danswick](http://twitter.com/danswick). 

Welcome!
