Web maps might look like digital wizardry, but anyone armed with a few basic skills can whip up an awesome-looking web-based map. This beginner-friendly workshop will cover what makes a web map tick. We'll discuss the technological innovations that brought us to today, the structure of common mapping strategies, and the tools you can use to put your geospatial data on the web. 
Come on out on Thursday, February 26th to get a primer on Web Maps. 

**We're switching locations this month**, so be sure to head to the Chicago Community Trust, 225 N Michigan Ave, #2200. We're also happy to announce that we'll be hosted by [Smart Chicago](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/), who are providing meeting space, food, and much appreciated outreach support. 

Maptime is always interactive, so **don't forget to bring your laptop**! As always, **beginners are very welcome**.
