![Open Gov Hack Night](http://opengovhacknight.org/images/cityofchicagotv-hacknight.png)

Come on out on Tuesday, December 16th to get acquainted with OpenStreetMap, level up your skills, or just make some edits in the company of other OSM fans. We'll be hanging out at [1871](http://www.1871.com/) for [Open Gov Hack Night's](http://opengovhacknight.org/) last meetup of the year. 

Maptime is always interactive, so **don't forget to bring your laptop**! Since we'll be doing lots of editing in OpenStreetMap, you might also want to bring a mouse. As always, **beginners are very welcome**.
