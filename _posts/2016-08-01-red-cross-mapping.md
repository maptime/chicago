## Our topic: Mapping disaster areas with the American Red Cross

_Beginners are always welcome_

Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people.

The American Red Cross and Maptime Chicago invite you to learn how you can easily contribute to world's map to benefit vulnerable communities everywhere. You'll learn about the history of crowd-sourced mapping as well as how to create your own OpenStreetMap account and begin using the simple map editing tools. We'll focus on a specific project, somewhere in the world, and contribute to the map collectivley.

Even better? Dinner will be provided.

**What we will do**

* Find places around the world that are prone to disaster areas
* Learn how to use iD editor to add buildings and roads to OpenStreetMap

**You will need**

* [Create an OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) before you come
