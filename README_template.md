## Maptime Starter site

Hosting your own meetup? Starter is desgined to be easily forked and tweaked to suit your own needs. Starter is a simple Jekyll theme for MapTime meetups. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.

## Installation

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/maptime/starter/fork/).
2. Edit the [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/maptime/starter/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml) file. Here's a quick rundown of the configuration options.

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseurl | Yes | post | This value should always be the same. |
| permalink | No | how urls are generated | You can learn more about how they are generated [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/). |
| markdown | No | Determines which markdown engine is used | Generally, you don't need to touch this field for your own needs. |
| paginate | Yes | Number of posts on the front page | Starter supports pagintaion. Control the number of posts on a given page by changing this value |
| repo | Yes | Name of the repo on GitHub | As an example, the name of the starter repo is `starter` |
| github_org | Yes | Name of the organization or username on GitHub | Most of the time this will be 'maptime' |
| maptime: chapter | Yes | Name of your MapTime meetup | |
| maptime: twitter | No | Your MapTime Twitter username | |
| maptime: disqus | No | Disqus account name | Starter optionally supports comments on posts with [Disqus](disqus.com). Create a new Disqus account for a site and fill this field with the account name. |

To get your site live, you will need to create a file named `CNAME` at the root folder of this repo to reflect your city's chapter. Add the text `maptime.io/` and your city's name. Example: `maptime.io/portland`. No other formatting is needed and you won't need the `http:` or any other text here.

### Content types

There are two kinds of content in Starter: post and event. You author these types of content in the `_posts` directory. Each content type has unique configuration options that you should declare at the top of the document. This is called [Frontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

#### Event
Events are for actual planned meetups with RSVP information. Note that the filename of the post should match the date of the meetup date.

##### Fronmatter options

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| layout | Yes | event | This value should always be the same. |
| category | Yes | event | This value should always be the same. |
| title | Yes | The title of your event | |
| rsvp | Yes | URL to rsvp | This should be a link to  an [Eventbrite](eventbrite.com) date or other service. |

#### Posts

Posts are like blog posts. These are great for meetup follow ups or posts that don't have a meetup event tied to it.

##### Fronmatter options

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| layout | Yes | post | This value should always be the same. |
| title | Yes | The title of your post | |
| author | No | Author's name | |
| image | No | URL path to an image | Images added here will show up as a [Twitter card](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) when a post is shared. |
