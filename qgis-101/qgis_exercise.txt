#maptimeBoston exercise! RAT MAP.

Intro to QGIS: Make a Map

The task for this exercise it to make a map of active Rodent Incidents in the City of Boston in September 2013.
The goal is learn how to use the features of QGIS Desktop, including adding data, projecting, running some
basic geoprocessing, and using the print composer.

1. Open up a new QGIS Project.

2. Add the following two layers:
	Boston Neighborhoods
	Rodent Activity 

	Find them on http://data.graphicarto.com/maptime-qgis.zip

	Unzip to access datasets.

3. Export and project the CSV
	Note: Use Massachusetts State Plane - Mainland Zone - Meters

4. Enable On-The-Fly Projections

5. Symbolize your Data!
	Right click and go to Properties -> Style
	Play with the Settings

6. Basic Geoprocessing
	Try a few geoprocessing tasks
		Perhaps Buffer around Rat Incidents
		Or use Point in Polygon to determin Rat Incidents by Neighborhood

7. Add basemap layers
	The downloaded ZIP includes a set of Boston layers including Hydro and Parks
	Or, use the Open Layers Plugin and add an OpenStreetMaps basemap!

7. Compose your Map
	Using the Print Composer!
	Add a Legend, Scale Bar, Data Sources, etc.

8. Export and Save

Some ideas to try:
	Make a map of the neighborhoods with the highest number of rat incidents
	Map all areas near a rat incident
	Map Rat Incidents by type and date
	Or find some other data, add it, and combine!
