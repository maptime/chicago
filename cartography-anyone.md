# Cartography, Anyone?  

## Topics! 

- Maps that people want to make all the time and how to make them
- Common pitfalls
- Map theory
- Projections! (and why)
- How to lie with maps
    + Normalization
    + How to break up your data
- Defining cartograpy (cartography isn't another term for maps)
- Map critique (why this decision, what do you notice)
- Tools??? Not illustrator because licenses. 
    + QGIS
    + Inkscape 
    + Mapbox studio but prob not because Carto CSS
- GP's QGIS carto / design presentation 
- Horses for courses (match output to audience, tech req's etc)
- Bare essentials boiled down
    + Hierarchy 
    + Message
    + Typography 
    + Color 
    + Line weight 
    + Choose print/static or interactive; code or GUI
- Beyond slapping a data layer onto some tiles 
    + Can start with bare essentials on CartoDB 
- If you start from print, you can do a lot more hand-placement of labels 
- Pick dataset and how you want to treat it, then go over different approaches to displaying it
- Continuous vs discreet data 
- How to use font weights, sizing, spacing correctly 


## Resources

## TUTORIAL 

- Color and hierarchy 
- How to lie with maps! (data representation techniques)
    + Give everyone the same dataset and compare approaches 
- Paint-by-numbers map:
    + Everyone gets the same data and pre-built map project (in QGIS) and let them make their own decisions 
    + Does this have to be tied into the tool that is being used? 
    + Groups? 
    + Longer session so you can covere the software? 
- Map Critiques! 
    + Fix Wiki Maps? 
    + Try to fix a map during the workshop 
    + Maps we love (maptime MSP) to keep things positive, prevent feeling of "experts bashing my work"
    + Show and tell
- Generalization and simplification
    + A city at lots of different scales 
    + SCALE! 
- Typography 
    + Labeling basemaps (streets, rivers, POIs and how to decide)
    + Rules of thumb 
    + Fonts, style, weight, kerning, spacing, text crashes 
    + QGIS template with data thrown in 
    + Lots of pictures! 
    + Start with a grayscale when talking about hierarchy 
- Oakland tut on map basics 
- Seattle intro to Q with a little carto at the end 
- Map touchups in illustrator, inkscape 
    + Pre-exported map
    + Separate tutorial in inkscape and/or GIMP (OMG)
- Carto CSS for carto
    + Intimidating at first, but might actually be easier than Q 
- A/B test QGIS vs Carto CSS between chapters? 
    + Split one maptime into two temas and regroup at the end 
- Explicit conversation about the purpose of the map 
- How basemap design affects decisions 
    + Design for data or design for ____ 
- Maybe don't even shoot for an output, but just talk about maps 
    + Map critique 
- Series! 


## Making a tutorial

- Get everyone on the same page on cartographic principles 
- Dan will make a repo (cartographic design) 
    + Wiki
    + Discussion in issues 
- If you have expertise on a specific area, start building out a module and they'll be pieced together
- Two track lesson, same map in QGIS and Carto CSS. Either a new map or replicated from something timely
- Bring in a list of sentimental places and put 'em on a map
